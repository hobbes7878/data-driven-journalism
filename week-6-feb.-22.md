#### Exercise 1: Practice SQL

For this exercise you may use either your own data from last week's homework _or_ the data from TEA we used in class last week.


- Use SQL to answer **three questions** about your data. If you're using your own data, these may be the same three questions you answered last week. If using TEA data from class, you need to ask three new questions.
- Use [Markdown code blocks and syntax highlighting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code-and-syntax-highlighting) to record your SQL queries in your data diary. (HINT: The syntax highlighting code for SQL is `sql`.)
- Make sure you write and answer your questions **in English**.

#### Exercise 2:
Draft pitches for **three** open records requests for electronic data you'd like to file with Texas public agencies as part of your midterm project.
- Describe the data you hope to get for each request.
- Research the agency you will be requesting the data from. What data do they make available online now, if any?
- Reach out to someone at the agency by telephone or email and ask them about the data you're requesting. What do they say about it?
- Each open records request should be pitched as a paragraph that tells me everything you know about the data you're requesting, including how big the dataset is, what's in it, and most importantly the story you think you could write after analyzing it.

Feel free to workshop your requests in Slack with each other and with me throughout the week.

Be prepared to talk through your favorite of your three requests in class.
    

##### What if I don't know what data to request?

Then you need to do all the more research. Cruise the websites of Texas state agencies. Look at research done by academics by topic on J-Store. Google for what stories other reporters have done in other states.

##### Remember

We're trying to tell a story that will be publishable in your school newspaper. Consider agencies that will deal with data appropriate for that publication like public universities or other educational institutions.

**NOTE: You should spend _far more time_ on Exercise 2 than 1 this week. Points lost if it's not obvious from your pitches that was the case.**

#### Inner join

Selects only those records matched in two tables.

#### Full join

Selects all records in both tables.

#### Left join

Selects all records from the first/left table and those matched in the last/right table.

#### Right join

Selects all records in the last/right table and those matched in the first/left table.
