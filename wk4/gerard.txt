Capitol Metro Collected this Data
The Agency uses this data so they can actually record the fixed transit routes used by all MetroBus lines and MetroRail lines
It spans over 9 months and the metadata was just updated
14 items
it ranges from the agengcy to the fares to the stops and stop times
When I open then they give me a link and the link i broken
The elements of bad data I see are that the data does not work, and there is minimal info about anything about the dataset
