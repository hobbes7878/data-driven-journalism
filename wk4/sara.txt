Dataset collected by Texas Departnment of Family and Protective Services.
I assume DFPS uses the data to track which entities are violating which statutes, and especially the frequency and severity of violations.
Data collected on inspections, so I would assume daily or close to daily.
Data collected from June 2014 to present
116,491 records in dataset
Single record represents single violation; separate violations observed simultaneously are recorded separately
Columns (12)
