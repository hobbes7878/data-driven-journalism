The classroom is **room 221**, which is a computer lab on the second floor of the building.



### Class computer/projector

The classroom has a computer and a projector. The projector must be turned on via a remote, which is usually on the lectern in the front of the class. The computer is a Windows machine.

**If you need to use any desktop-installed software, I strongly encourage you to bring your own computer.** There is, however, one hitch to that plan: the projector only has VGA hookup. There is no HDMI or thunderbolt connection available.

If you're really stuck, I have screen-shared with the class computer via Google hangouts before, but best bet is to find an adaptor before class you can use.

To connect the projector to your computer, just unplug the VGA cable from the back of the class computer and plug it into your own.
