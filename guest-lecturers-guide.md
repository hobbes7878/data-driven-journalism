Park in one of the visitor parking spots in the parking lot in front of Carpenter Hall (Parking Lot A on Google Maps).

The classroom is **Room 221**, which is a computer lab on the second floor of the building.


### Class computer/projector

The classroom has a computer and a projector for the lecturer. The projector must be turned on via a remote, which is usually on the lectern in the front of the class. The computer is a Windows machine.

**If you need to use any desktop-installed software, I strongly encourage you to bring your own computer.** You will not have admin rights to install additional software on the computer.

There is, however, one hitch: the projector **only has VGA hookups**. There is no HDMI or thunderbolt connection available.

If you're really stuck, I have screen-shared with the class computer via Google hangouts before, but your best bet is to find an adaptor before class you can use.

To connect the projector to your computer, just unplug the VGA cable from the back of the class computer and plug it into your own.

To login to the classroom computer, use my login details:

### Before class

If you need the class to prepare or install anything before your lecture, please let me know and I will email the students instructions.

### Class materials

**Let me encourage you to tightly choreograph your lesson plan.** Remember, these students are learning both the technical skills and theoretical basis of what you're teaching them in one go. Having a slick lesson plan that you've already run through once to make sure it works will greatly aid them in learning and retaining the lesson.

It's useful to have a course outline for the students to follow both during and after your class, especially if you're writing any code. You are welcome to directly edit this documentation for your class week or you can also send me a single markdown file with your class plan, and I will add it to these docs for the students.

### In-class grade

Class participation is graded on a simple 3 point scale.

Usually students participate and all get the full 3 points in class, but if you have trouble with anyone paying attention, please get their name and let me know how many points to deduct.
