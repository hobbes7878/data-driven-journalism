# JRN-3V50: Data-driven Journalism

### Course description

Data journalism is a set of techniques to acquire and communicate truths hidden in electronic records. The inputs can be as simple as a spreadsheet or as voluminous as databases of millions of electronic records. The outputs are compelling statistics, evidence-backed narratives and deeply immersive data visualizations.

In this course, we’ll look at data journalism’s interdisciplinary roots, drawing from fields as diverse as mathematics, computer science, information design, social science and psychology. We won’t consider data journalism as a specialization, but as a basic skillset every journalist needs to work a beat in the information age.

Students will learn to wield basic statistics for good, not evil; to use software to find the story no else can; to distill abstract data into arresting visualizations and to write a data story with soul.

Coursework will include critical readings of contemporary and classic examples of data journalism. Students will also request electronic records from government agencies through open records laws, clean dirty data programmatically, use basic statistics to find the story buried in electronic records and create truthful and compelling data visualizations. Students will be expected to execute a substantial work of journalism that uses publically available data as a final project.

### Grades

- 40% - Class participation
- 30% - Midterm project
- 30% - Final project

#### Class participation

Class participation will be graded after every class on a 3-point scale:

**3 points:** You came to class obviously prepared, participated in that day's discussion with original insights that forwarded the conversation or proved you were proficient in an assigned data journalism technique.

**2 points:** You came and participated in the discussion, but mostly just reacted to what other people said rather than give your own original take. It was not entirely clear to me you read all required reading or completed all of the assignments for that day's class.

**1 point:** You were not an active participant in class conversation. It was clear to me you did not complete required readings or assignments before class.

In rare cases, a class participation grade will include a reading quiz. These will not be pop quizzes. More regularly, you will produce proof you completed an exercise in class as part of your participation grade.

If you're worried about your participation grade, ask me **sooner rather than later** how you're doing and how you can improve. If you're engaged in this class and attend, there is no reason you won't get full marks.

#### Midterm project

The midterm project will require you to identify a public dataset and acquire it from a public agency using open records laws.

#### Final project

The final project will challenge you to complete an act of journalism by analyzing a public dataset and reporting a significant finding through clear copy and data visualization, i.e., a story.

You may propose to work on a suitably large dataset in a small group, but my preference will be that everyone produces a final project independently.

### Required materials

There are no required textbooks for this class. All readings will be distributed electronically.

You will need to bring your own laptop to class. If you do not own a laptop, please see me.

### House rules


#### Attendance

This is a once-weekly class, so attendance is important. That said, I will not take attendance, _per se_. You will instead be graded on your participation in class.

If you miss a class, you will get **zero participation points** for that session.

If you have a medical, family or other emergency that kept you from class, then you can make up _2 points_ if you earn 3 points the next session _and_ can demonstrate you've mastered the material you missed.

Please expect each class to last the duration of the time allotted.

#### Classroom etiquette

Please silence your cell phones in class and refrain from checking them while other people are speaking.

You may bring food into class as long as you don't make a mess and aren't disruptive to class discussion.


#### How to communicate with me and with each other

We will use modern technologies to communicate in this class. Namely, [Slack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RJZMSsH7-g), which is a free team-based comms platform that we use at _The Dallas Morning News_.

Slack is where I will post class assignments, leave discussion questions, post cool examples of data journalism in the wild and respond to your questions outside of class during waking hours.

I will send invitations during our first class to join our class Slack team. You can then access the team either via the Slack [desktop application](https://slack.com/downloads) or through the [online app](https://slack.com/signin). The team name is our course number: **JRN-3V50**.

**Note:** In some cases, I may ask assignments or other materials be emailed to my personal email, above. Those will be exceptions to the rule and clearly communicated.

#### Code of conduct

We will discuss issues in journalism during this course over which reasonable people can and will disagree. I ask that you respect one another's views in class in accordance with university policies and guidelines.

Any intimidation, harassment or otherwise threatening behavior by any member of this class against any other will not be tolerated and will be reported to the university or other appropriate authority, so play nice.

Do your own work, and when working in a group, be sure you are an equal contributor on projects and assignments. Again, see attendant guidelines from the university re: plagiarism, etc.



#### Disability accommodations

Please let me know of any special accommodations you may need due to a disability. As usual, university policies and guidelines will apply.
