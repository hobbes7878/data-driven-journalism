# JRN-3V50: Data-driven Journalism

### Course description

Data journalism is a set of techniques to acquire and communicate truths hidden in electronic records. The inputs can be as simple as a spreadsheet or as voluminous as databases of millions of electronic records. The outputs are compelling statistics, evidence-backed narratives and deeply immersive data visualizations.

In this course, we’ll look at data journalism’s interdisciplinary roots, drawing from fields as diverse as mathematics, computer science, information design, social science and psychology. We won’t consider data journalism as a specialization, but as a basic skillset every journalist needs to work a beat in the information age.

Students will learn to wield basic statistics for good, not evil; to use software to find the story no else can; to distill abstract data into arresting visualizations and to write a data story with soul.

Coursework will include critical readings of contemporary and classic examples of data journalism. Students will also request electronic records from government agencies through open records laws, clean dirty data programmatically, use basic statistics to find the story buried in electronic records and create truthful and compelling data visualizations. Students will be expected to execute a substantial work of journalism that uses publically available data as a final project.

### Grades

- 40% - Class participation
- 30% - Midterm project
- 30% - Final project

##### Class participation

Class participation will be graded after every class on a 3-point scale:

**3 points:** You came to class obviously prepared, participated in discussion with original insights that forwarded class conversation. 

**2 points:** You came and participated in the discussion, but mostly just reacted to what other people said, rather than give your own original take. It was not entirely clear to me you read all required reading or completed all of the assignments for that day's class.

**1 point:** You were not an active participant in class conversation. It was clear to me you did not complete required readings or assignments before class.

If you're worried about your participation grade, come see me **sooner rather than later** to discuss how you're doing and how you can improve your grade.


### House rules


#### Attendance

This is a once-weekly class, so attendance is important. That said, I will not take attendance, _per se_. You will instead be graded on your participation in class.

If you miss a class, you will get **zero participation points** for that session.

If you have a medical, family or other emergency that kept you from class, then you can make up _one point_ if you earn 3 points the next session. Because each class will build on the one before, you will not get those 3 points unless you've also learned the stuff you missed.

Please expect each class to last the duration of the time allotted, even if it doesn't.

#### Classroom etiquette

Please silence your cell phones in class and refrain from checking them while other people are speaking.

#### Code of conduct

We will discuss issues in journalism during this course over which reasonable people can and will disagree. I ask that you respect one another's views in class in accordance with university policies and guidelines.

Any intimidation, harassment or otherwise threatening behavior by any member of this class against any other will not be tolerated and will be reported to the university or other appropriate authority, so play nice.

Do your own work, and when working in a group, be sure you are an equal contributor on projects and assignments. Again, see attendant guidelines from the university re: plagiarism, etc.

#### How to communicate with me and with each other

We will use modern technologies to communicate in this class. Namely, [Slack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RJZMSsH7-g), which is a free team-based comms platform that we use at _The Dallas Morning News_.

Slack is where I will post class assignments, leave discussion questions, post cool examples of data journalism in the wild and respond to your questions during waking hours.

I will send invitations during our first class to join our class Slack team. You can then access the team either via the Slack [desktop application](https://slack.com/downloads) or through the [online app](https://slack.com/signin). The team name is our course number: **JRN-3V50**.

**Note:** In some cases, I may ask assignments or other materials be emailed to my personal email, above. Those will be exceptions to the rule and clearly communicated.

#### Disability accommodations

Please let me know of any special accommodations you may need due to a disability. As usual, university policies and guidelines will apply.
