# Final project

![](/assets/book.png)

Your final project in this class will be due **by noon on Monday, May 8.** 

You will write a comprehensive data diary. 

Use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and name the file `diary.md`.

#### Part 1

Your diary will include a complete narrative of the open records requests you filed in class. Please date and briefly summarize any correspondence or phone conversations you had with staff at the agency while making your request. You will attach any copies of correspondence to your data diary. Please organize these copies, including your original request, chronologically (preferably as PDFs) in a folder titled "**records request**".

If you received data from the agency, please include it in its raw form in the same folder.

#### Part 2

The second, and most significant, part of your data diary will document your own original analysis of a dataset.

There is no restriction on which dataset you choose for analysis, but it must lend itself to interesting questions and viable journalistic interest, i.e., you can describe the story you would write off it. (Ideally, though, you would use the data you requested in Part 1.)

You should document the source and contents of your dataset, including a breakdown of the fields in the data. Document any cleaning you needed to do of the data and the steps you took to import the data into a database.

Clearly list the questions you will ask your dataset. **This will be the most significant part of the grade for your final project.** Come up with good, journalistic questions!

You must show evidence that you used SQL to help answer those questions. Your SQL queries should be included in your diary and also written Markdown with the correct [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code). (Hint: the syntax highlighting code is `sql`.)

Describe in detail any other data analysis steps you take.

Finally, you should summarize your findings and outline the story you believe you could tell with the data.

Put your raw data files and any other files in a folder called **data analysis**.

#### Turning it in

Your final package to me should include your data diary and folders for your data analysis files and open records correspondence.

You will email me your final package by noon, Monday, May 8 -- jon.r.mcclure@gmail.com.

If your data files are too large for email, zip them up and send me the compressed file. If they are still too large, you may share them with me via Google Drive or Dropbox.

#### Grading

There is no word count or page minimum. You are expected to write a comprehensive report that provides me with ample evidence you have learned the skills needed to request records, analyze data and interpret meaningful and statistically valid conclusions in the service of journalism.

Your data diary will be graded on the following measures, which I will score on a ten-point scale and then weight according to the percentages below:

- Quality of dataset and creative analysis questions: **30%**
- Records request narrative and supporting docs: **20%**
- Proficiency with SQL: **15%**
- Clearly documented analysis: **15%**
- Solid conclusions and well-written findings: **15%**
- Cleanly organized diary and Markdown formatting: **5%**


#### Extra credit opportunity

You can make up as many as 10 points by creating dataviz from your data analysis. I will apply the points to any you missed, starting with the highest weighted category. Most simple charts will only earn a couple points. Show me something ambitious for the full 10.

#### Good luck!
