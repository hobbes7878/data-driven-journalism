#### Exercise:

Pick a publicly available dataset from a Texas municipal or state agency website. (Preferably one that actually interests you.) Download it and open it in Excel. Begin a **"data diary"** about your dataset. You should answer as many of the following questions in your data diary as apply to your data.

- Who collected this data?
- What does the agency use this data for, i.e., why do they collect it?
- When is the data collected?
- What time span does the data cover?
- How many records are in the dataset?
- What does a single record represent in the data?
- Describe each column of the dataset, individually:
    - What data is in this column?
    - What _kind_ of data does it contain, e.g., character strings, numbers, dates, etc.?
    - If the column contains numeric data, what is the maximum and minimum value in the column? What's the average?
    - What if any codes are used in this column and what do they mean?
- Using Quartz's guide, what elements of "bad data" do you see in this dataset, if any?

    
### Important: 
Data diaries are due by **noon Tuesday**. Please send them to me via Slack in the #assignments channel.

## Terminology

### Kinds of Data

#### Qualitative
Qualitative data represent categorical values like the color of people's eyes or the make and model of automobiles.

This data always represents **discrete** values, meaning you are either one or the other type (whatever "type" means in your data), nothing in between.


#### Quantitative
Quantitative data represent numeric data like the temperature yesterday or your annual salary.

#### Discrete

Discrete data represent a limited set of possible values that data can take.

- **All** qualitative data is discrete. Your eyes are either blue or green or brown.
- **Some** quantitative data is discrete. Your car engine has either 4 cylinders or 6 or 8.

#### Continuous

Continuous data represent an infinite (or practically infinite) set of possible values that data can take.

- **No** qualitative data is continuous.
- **Some** quantitative data is continuous. The temperature is 55 degrees, or it can be 55.5 or 55.55 or 55.555


### Data types

#### String
A "string" or characters. Your name is a string.

#### Integer
A whole number like 4 and 5.

#### Floating point number / Float / Decimal
A decimal number like 4.3 or 5.2.

#### Date / Datetime
A numeric representation of a date or a date and a time.

#### Boolean
True or False
