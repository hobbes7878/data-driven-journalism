#### Exercise:

Pick a publicly available dataset from a Texas municipal or state agency website. (Preferably one that actually interests you.) Download it and open it in Excel. Begin a **"data diary"** about your dataset. You should answer as many of the following questions in your data diary as apply to your data.

- Who collected this data and what do they use it for?
- 
- How many records are in the dataset?
- 
- Describe each column of the dataset individually:
    - What kind of data does it contain, e.g., character strings, numbers, currency, dates, etc.?
    - What if any codes are used in this column and what do they describe?
    
### Important: 
Data diaries are due by noon Tuesday. Please send them to me via Slack.
