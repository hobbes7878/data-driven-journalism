#### Exercise:

- Complete the [Markdown tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).
- Convert the data diary you wrote last week into Markdown format (Re-save it as `diary.md`).
- Add to your new Markdown file.
    - Ask at least 3 questions of your dataset. (Think critically! Points lost for shallow, I'm-just-trying-to-complete-the-assignment questions.)
    - Use your basic Excel skills to answer them.
    - Record your questions, answers and the steps you took in your diary.
    - Be sure you write the answers to your question in English prose, as though you were intending to publish your findings in a story.

#### For example:

If you have a dataset of college salaries, you might ask:
- How much better are tenured professors paid than adjuncts?
- Which school has the most clerical staff earning below $40K per year?
- In which school are men's and women's salaries most different?

You would answer those questions in **publishable English** like so:

> The average salary for men and women is most different in the business school, where men earn $25,000 more on average than their female colleagues.

You would document each step you took to arrive at that conclusion in your diary.
