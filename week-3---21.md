#### Exercise:

Look through Texas public records requests filed through [Muckrock](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/list/?page=1&per_page=100&jurisdiction=109), a non-profit site that hosts and shares open records requests. Choose one that was sent to a Texas government agency or other group that is subject to TPIA and be prepared to tell the story of that request in class. You should be able to answer these questions:
- Who filed the request?
- What data or records were asked for?
- What agency was the request sent to?
- What is that agency normally responsible for, i.e., what do they do there?
- How was the request framed?
- How did the agency respond?
- Did the agency ask for a ruling from the Attorney General's office?
- How long did the request take?
- What was the final outcome?

Also please find the section in the Attorney General's [Public Information Handbook](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/og/publicinfo_hb.pdf) that you think is most relevant to whether the requested records are public records.

**So that not everyone grabs the same request,** please post the name of the request you're picking on the #assignments channel in Slack as early as you can. First come, first serve; and I may suggest alternatives if the one you pick doesn't have much depth/is kinda boring.
